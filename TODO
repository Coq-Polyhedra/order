* automation to deal with duplicated statements
* automation to generate order.v
* remove lemmas in order.v -> solve the issues regarding displays
* in finlattices, we need to think (hard) about morphims
* cpo, for program verification logic (weakly memory models)
* nonunique complements of lattices (parameterized by lattice instances) -> vector subspaces
* cubical model of type theory (!)
* interface between the unbundled view and the subtype/bundled view, automation. In Coq-Polyhedra, the communication between 'poly[R]_n and {poly base} (subtypes of polyhedra that can be expressed using a certain set of (in)equalities). In order, interface between finlattices and the corresponding tbLattice (on the associated subtype). Problems for induced morphisms (need to change the domain).
