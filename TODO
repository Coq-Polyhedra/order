* automation to deal with duplicated statements
* automation to generate order.v
* remove lemmas in order.v -> solve the issues regarding displays
* in finlattices, we need to think (hard) about morphims
* cpo, for program verification logic (weakly memory models)
* nonunique complements of lattices (parameterized by lattice instances) -> vector subspaces
* cubical model of type theory (!)
